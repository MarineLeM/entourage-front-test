### Requirement
Currently working with node version 20.11.1


### Personal choice
* I intalled in this project, react-router-dom and also a @mui/material

* Both 'type' and 'interface' can be used to define the props of a component in TypeScript
  Interface is more convenient for big project or object-oriented approach (because it can be extended and merged in different part of the code)
  In this code exemple I choose to use 'type'

* in src\styles\variables.css there is the css main variables

* i used guest session to create watching list, and i store the guest session id inside the localStorage and the store ( i create a hook to get the id every where in the application)
